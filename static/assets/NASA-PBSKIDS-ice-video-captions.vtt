BOY:
Ice is something we've all seen.

00:03.300 --> 00:06.700
Whether it's ice on a lake
or ice in your glass.

00:06.700 --> 00:09.067
All ice shares some
special properties.

00:09.067 --> 00:11.133
But just what are
those properties?

00:11.133 --> 00:13.767
And what makes ice so different
from other solids?

00:13.767 --> 00:16.200
To find out, let's turn
to some people at NASA

00:16.200 --> 00:18.367
who've made a career
out of studying ice.

00:18.367 --> 00:19.700
Well, fundamentally,
you probably already know

00:19.700 --> 00:21.300
what ice is.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.433
It's that ice cube that's
in your freezer

00:23.433 --> 00:24.700
or in your cold drink.

00:24.700 --> 00:26.967
Ice at its most fundamental
is frozen water.

00:26.967 --> 00:28.733
When water hits
a certain temperature,

00:28.733 --> 00:31.967
which is 32 degrees Fahrenheit
or 0 degrees Celsius,

00:31.967 --> 00:33.100
it freezes.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.700
And here we have an example
of this: here's ice.

00:35.700 --> 00:38.900
This ice was liquid water
not too long ago.

00:38.900 --> 00:41.433
And it just reached a certain
temperature, and it expanded

00:41.433 --> 00:43.667
and it froze
into this solid block.

00:43.667 --> 00:45.500
NEUMANN:
Ice is important to our world

00:45.500 --> 00:48.267
because it's one of the main
parts of the planet

00:48.267 --> 00:51.933
that controls our climate:
how warm or how cool it is.

00:51.933 --> 00:54.700
In the polar areas--
so, close to the North Pole,

00:54.700 --> 00:57.367
close to the South Pole--
it's cold year-round,

00:57.367 --> 00:59.500
and we find a lot of ice there.

00:59.500 --> 01:02.733
And that ice affects what
our weather is like here

01:02.733 --> 01:03.733
in the United States.

01:03.733 --> 01:05.433
CAMERON:
When most solids are heated,

01:05.433 --> 01:07.000
they melt into liquids.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.067
When a liquid cools down,
it freezes into a solid.

01:10.067 --> 01:11.700
But water is special,

01:11.700 --> 01:14.667
because something very different
happens when it becomes a solid.

01:14.667 --> 01:17.233
NEUMANN:
Ice is a really unique solid.

01:17.233 --> 01:20.867
A lot of other liquids, as
they freeze and form a solid,

01:20.867 --> 01:22.967
that solid is heavier
and it's dense

01:22.967 --> 01:25.167
and it sinks down to
the bottom of the liquid.

01:25.167 --> 01:28.300
But, as you know, your ice cube
floats in a glass of water.

01:28.300 --> 01:30.533
So, when you freeze water
to make ice,

01:30.533 --> 01:33.500
it's actually less dense
than the water.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.300
And so it floats
right up on the top.

01:35.300 --> 01:37.500
We have a glass of water,

01:37.500 --> 01:40.267
just regular room-temperature
water, and we take ice--

01:40.267 --> 01:42.733
which is 32 degrees or below.

01:42.733 --> 01:46.500
And if we drop a couple ice
cubes in this water,

01:46.500 --> 01:48.833
we see that
it definitely floats.

01:48.833 --> 01:50.967
We see that it is definitely
less dense

01:50.967 --> 01:52.533
than the liquid water.

01:52.533 --> 01:54.167
CAMERON: But floating ice
is really important

01:54.167 --> 01:55.733
for life on Earth, too.

01:55.733 --> 01:58.567
If frozen water did not float,
it would sink to the bottom

01:58.567 --> 02:01.667
of a lake or a pond,
or even the ocean.

02:01.667 --> 02:04.933
The summer sun would melt someÂ 
  of the ice, but not all of it.

02:04.933 --> 02:07.767
Every year, more ice would sink
to the bottom until the lakes

02:07.767 --> 02:10.267
and the rivers filled with ice
and became solid.

02:10.267 --> 02:12.167
But ice floats in liquid water,

02:12.167 --> 02:15.500
so our lakes and oceans don't
freeze from the bottom up.

02:15.500 --> 02:18.133
Even in cold weather, living
things can still live

02:18.133 --> 02:21.033
in the liquid water that
is under the ice.

02:21.033 --> 02:24.567
Water, both liquid and solid,
makes our world

02:24.567 --> 02:26.200
a special place to live.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.900
